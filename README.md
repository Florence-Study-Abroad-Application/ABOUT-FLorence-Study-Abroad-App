# ABOUT-FLorence-Study-Abroad-App

Our Purpose:
To consolidate consolidate trip information and ease  the registration process
for students interested in studying abroad in Italy over the summer.

Our Users:
This app is being built for students of Maryville University (MU) who are interested
or currently planning a study abroad trip to Florence, Italy.

The App's Ability:
Currently, the trip information is in physical paper pamplets and the registration
process is also a separate entity. Our application will consolidate all of this into 
an easily accessible locate.
